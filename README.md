# Webpage for Horiseon

This repository includes the index.html, image assets, and a css style sheets, including both a reset to optimize webpage for all browsers, and a general style css for formating the webpage. I managed to get some HTML Semantic elements to work like header and footer but all other attempts were failures. Ran out of time trying to get other elements to work so I just stuck with what worked even though not correct according to homework specifics.
